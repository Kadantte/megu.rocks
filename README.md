## Self-hosting configuration:
These are all environment variables:

```MEGU_DIRECTORY``` : Directory containing images. Note that we do not serve static files for you, so use nginx or similar for static files.

That's all! If you want to change anything else you're better off modifying the source code.

## (Unofficial) API Wrappers:
- No API wrappers are available at the moment or aren't being actively maintained anymore

If you would like your API wrapper added here, feel free to make a PR!
